Hello! My name is Brian Zhang, and I will be the sponsor and organizer for this contest!

Welcome to the first ever HHS auditing competition!

## How the competition will work:
You will have the entire time period listed above to go over the material within the corresponding competition folder. For example, information about the Septober contest will go in the Septober folder. There will be a short description here, as well. Each contest will have their own set of rules and submissions, however, everything is due at 11:59 p.m. on the final day of each competition. NO EXCEPTIONS. This contest is made for the purpose of promoting auditing and the dangerous of cryptography.
